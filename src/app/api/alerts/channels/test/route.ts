/**
 * Send a real notification through one channel, and say what happened.
 *
 * The point is that a channel is otherwise only proven at the moment it
 * matters — the first time something actually breaks. A webhook URL with a
 * typo, an email provider whose key was never set, a Slack app removed from
 * the workspace: all three look identical to a working channel until an alert
 * fires and quietly goes nowhere.
 *
 * This is the one place the app deliberately sends on demand, so it is metered
 * per organization: a send button is an outbound-request button, and one that
 * anyone signed in can hold down is a way to make Bussola's egress somebody
 * else's problem.
