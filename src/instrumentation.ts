/**
 * Next runs this once per server process.
 *
 * Two jobs, both self-hosted only.
 *
 * Migrations: a single-server install should just work after `npm run dev`.
 * Making someone run a migration command first — and getting "relation does
 * not exist" when they don't — is a bad first five minutes for a product whose
 * pitch is plug-and-play. Cloud keeps migrations an explicit deploy step,
 * because several instances racing to migrate is its own failure mode.
 *
 * Sync: a self-hosted install is one long-running server, so it hosts the
 * scheduler itself and needs no second process. Cloud is replicated and/or
 * serverless, where an in-process loop would run once per instance and fight
 * over the queue — there the worker runs standalone (`npm run worker`) or on a
 * cron hitting /api/internal/sync.
