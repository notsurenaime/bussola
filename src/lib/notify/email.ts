/**
 * Sending email, for alerts and invitations.
 *
 * Deliberately over HTTP rather than SMTP: SMTP would mean a dependency, a
 * connection pool and a class of failure (blocked port 25, STARTTLS
 * negotiation) that is miserable to debug on someone else's server. A single
 * `fetch` to a provider that already has to work for the app's own users is
 * less machinery and fails in ways the error message can explain.
 *
 * Nothing here is configured by default, and that is on purpose. A
 * self-hosted install that has not set a key gets `configured: false` and a
 * sentence saying which variables to set — never a silent no-op, because an
 * alert that quietly does not send is worse than one that was never offered.
