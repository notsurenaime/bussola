/**
 * A minimal Model Context Protocol server, over JSON-RPC 2.0.
 *
 * Written directly against the wire format rather than pulling in an SDK: the
 * streamable-HTTP surface a stateless tool server actually needs is four
 * methods, and hand-rolling them keeps the dependency count — and therefore
 * the audit surface of something that answers to a bearer token — where it is.
 *
 * Stateless by design. There is no session to resume, no server-initiated
 * message, and no subscription: every request carries its own token and is
 * answered on its own. That makes it safe to run on serverless, where a
 * long-lived SSE stream would be cut mid-conversation anyway.
